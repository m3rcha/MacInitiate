# MacInitiate Product Context

## Problem Statement
Setting up a new Mac or reinstalling macOS is time-consuming and error-prone. Users must manually:
- Search for and download dozens of applications
- Remember and execute system tweak commands
- Handle installation failures individually
- Restart services after configuration changes

## Solution Overview
MacInitiate solves this by providing a visual interface where users can:
1. Browse apps by category (Development, Design, Productivity, etc.)
2. Select system tweaks (Show hidden files, disable animations, etc.)
3. Choose from preset configurations (Dev setup, Gaming rig, etc.)
4. Generate a single, robust installation script
5. Download and execute with confidence

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Complete app selection in under 2 minutes
- **Clarity**: Clear visual feedback during script generation
- **Reliability**: Scripts that don't fail completely on individual app issues
- **Trust**: Transparent script generation with visible safety checks

## Target Users
- Developers setting up new work machines
- Power users customizing fresh macOS installations
- IT professionals deploying standardized configurations
- Users migrating between Macs

## Core Value Proposition
"Select your apps, generate a script, install everything automatically without worrying about individual failures."

## Success Scenarios
1. New developer selects "Dev Preset" + additional tools → generates working script
2. User picks specific design apps + UI tweaks → script installs apps and applies tweaks
3. Network interruption during installation → script continues with remaining apps
4. One app fails to install → script reports failure but completes other installations
