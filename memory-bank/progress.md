## Known Issues & Technical Debt
- **App Catalog Gap:** Only 3 apps implemented vs target 200+ (needs expansion)
- **Template Module:** Templates section shows placeholder (not implemented)
- **Script Generator:** Generation section shows placeholder (not implemented)

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Decision History
1. **Static Data Approach (Confirmed):** Chosen over external database for reliability and simplicity
2. **Client-Side Generation (Confirmed):** Eliminates server dependencies and improves privacy
3. **2025 Standard Rule (Established):** Strict modern tool curation policy
4. **Developer-First UX (Confirmed):** Dark mode, keyboard navigation, power user features
5. **Next.js App Router (Confirmed):** Modern React framework with optimal performance

### Rejected Alternatives
- **External Database:** Too complex for MVP, adds single point of failure
- **Server-Side Generation:** Adds latency, privacy concerns, and infrastructure costs
- **Legacy Tool Support:** Conflicts with 2025 Standard, complicates curation
- **jQuery/Vanilla JS:** Incompatible with modern development practices

### Future Considerations
- **Community Features:** May add GitHub-based contribution system post-MVP
- **Enterprise Features:** Team configurations and centralized management
- **Platform Expansion:** Linux/Windows variants after macOS success
- **Mobile Apps:** Native iOS/Android apps for remote management

## Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- **None:** Phase 0 proceeding smoothly

### External Dependencies
- **Homebrew:** Package availability and naming conventions
- **Mac App Store:** MAS CLI tool for App Store apps
- **macOS Updates:** System preference command stability

### Resource Requirements
- **Development Time:** Estimated 40-60 hours for MVP implementation
- **Testing Infrastructure:** macOS VMs for script validation
- **Design Assets:** Custom illustrations and marketing materials
